    Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird" class="link italic">The Little White Bird</a> (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters 13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens" class="link">Kensington Gardens</a> in London, where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_play" class="link">stage play</a> titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy" class="link italic">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a>, which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre" class="link">Duke of York's Theatre</a> in London.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3" class="link"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodder_and_Stoughton" class="link">Hodder and Stoughton</a>, extracted the Peter Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens" class="link italic">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a>, with the addition of illustrations by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham" class="link">Arthur Rackham</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel" class="link">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy" class="link italic">Peter and Wendy</a>.

    J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-5" class="link"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
